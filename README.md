# Predictive-Model-Using-LSA-Via-SVD
A fuel company has 250+ gas stations in the US. It captures customers’ comments via phone, which are merged with numeric variables by matching them with the company’s royalty card number. All data were provided in the Gastextnumericdata file. Some of the text comments, variable names, and descriptions were disguised to protect the identity of the client company.  The target variable is identified by the column name.  CustID, and LoyalStatus are nominal variables, and all other variables are binary.  Comment column contains the text information.  Predict the target Using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
